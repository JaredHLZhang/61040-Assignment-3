Amy: Heyyy, I finally caught you! Were you napping?
Jay: (laughs) Not yet. I was just lying on the couch, staring at the ceiling, debating whether to make coffee at 9 p.m. or not.
Amy: Oh my god, please don’t. You’ll never sleep.
Jay: Yeah, but then I can stay up longer to talk to you. Tempting, right?
Amy: Aww, smooth. But I’d rather have a well-rested Jay than a zombie Jay.
Jay: (chuckling) Okay, fine. So how was your day? Tell me everything, start to finish.
Amy: Hmmm… Well, classes were okay. I had that presentation I was freaking out about yesterday.
Jay: Oh right, the one with all the charts? How did it go?
Amy: Honestly, better than I expected! My professor even said I looked confident, which is hilarious because I was dying inside.
Jay: Babe, I knew you’d kill it. You always underestimate yourself.
Amy: (teasing) Yeah, yeah, keep flattering me. It works.
Jay: I’m not flattering, I’m being honest.
Amy: (soft laugh) Okay, your turn. What did you do today?
Jay: Uhhh… let’s see. I worked on that project deadline for most of the day. My brain felt like mashed potatoes by the afternoon. Then I went for a short run, and of course, I was wishing you were here to run with me.
Amy: Aww. I would’ve slowed you down though.
Jay: Nah, you would’ve made it fun. Running alone kinda sucks.
Amy: (smiling through voice) You’re cute.
Jay: You too. So, when you finished your presentation, did you celebrate?
Amy: Yeah, I treated myself to bubble tea. Sat there alone like a true queen.
Jay: (laughing) I wish I was there to steal a sip.
Amy: You would’ve, too. You’re the worst.
Jay: So, bubble tea queen, what flavor did you get this time?
Amy: (proudly) Taro with oat milk, less ice, 30% sugar. My ultimate combo.
Jay: Ugh, you and your fancy customizations. I just get classic milk tea every time.
Amy: (laughs) Because you’re boring.
Jay: Excuse me? I’m “consistent,” thank you very much.
Amy: Mhmm, sure. But you know what? If we were together, I’d make you try all the flavors until you admitted taro is superior.
Jay: (mock gasp) Superior?! Taro tastes like purple mystery goo.
Amy: (laughing hard) Stop, you’re so mean! It’s delicious.
Jay: Okay, okay. Next time we’re together, I’ll try it. For you.
Amy: That’s all I ask. (pause) …I miss you, Jay.
Jay: (softer) I miss you too.
Amy: Some days it feels okay, but today it hit me harder. Like when I was walking home with my bubble tea, I caught myself wishing you were there next to me, stealing half of it.
Jay: (gentle laugh) That actually sounds exactly like me. I’d drink half, then complain it was too sweet.
Amy: And I’d roll my eyes. (sighs) We’re so predictable.
Jay: Predictably perfect.
Amy: (smiling through the phone) Cheesy. But… I needed that.
Jay: I’ll always supply the cheese. Unlimited subscription.
Amy: (giggles) You’re ridiculous.
Amy: (yawns softly) Sorry, I’m kinda sleepy already.
Jay: (concerned) Aw, did you stay up late last night again?
Amy: Yeah… I was finishing my slides, then I went down a rabbit hole watching cooking videos at like 1 a.m.
Jay: (laughs) That sounds like you. What were you watching?
Amy: This girl making Korean egg sandwiches. You know the ones with fluffy eggs and toast?
Jay: Ohhh, the ones with cheese melting out?
Amy: Yes! They looked so good. I swear I could smell them through the screen.
Jay: (teasing) You’re torturing yourself at 1 a.m. with food videos. Classic Amy move.
Amy: (laughs) Guilty. If you were here, I’d make you cook them for me.
Jay: Me? Why me?
Amy: Because you always make better eggs. Mine turn out rubbery.
Jay: (smiling) Okay, deal. Next time we’re together, I’ll make you midnight egg sandwiches.
Amy: (soft pause) Can’t wait…
(there’s a few seconds of silence, just breathing over the line)
Jay: You went quiet. What’s on your mind?
Amy: Just… thinking how nice it’ll be. Like actually being in the same kitchen instead of just talking about it.
Jay: (gentle tone) Yeah. I think about that a lot too. Even dumb things, like brushing our teeth side by side.
Amy: (laughs softly) That’s not dumb. That’s sweet.
Jay: (smiling) You’d probably hog the sink, though.
Amy: (mock offended) Hey! I’d make room for you.
Jay: (teasing) Uh-huh, sure.
Amy: (laughs again, then sighs) God, I miss even arguing with you in person.
Jay: Soon, baby. Just a few more weeks till winter break.
Amy: (brightens) True… I’ve got the countdown on my phone.
Jay: Me too. We’re hopeless.
Amy: (laughing) Hopelessly in love.
Amy: You know what I miss the most?
Jay: What?
Amy: Just… walking together. Like holding hands, not even saying anything. Just walking.
Jay: (soft chuckle) I know. I think about that a lot when I walk home from work. It feels too quiet without you.
Amy: (playfully) You mean you don’t talk to yourself?
Jay: (laughs) Sometimes I do! But then I think, “If Amy saw me right now, she’d make fun of me forever.”
Amy: Oh, absolutely. I’d record it as blackmail.
Jay: (mock gasp) Evil!
Amy: (laughs) But you love me anyway.
Jay: Too much, probably.
Amy: (soft smile in voice) Not possible.
(there’s a short pause, just the sound of them breathing on each other’s line)
Jay: By the way, did you ever book your bus ticket yet? For winter break?
Amy: Not yet. I’m waiting to see if I can get Friday afternoon off instead of evening. If I leave earlier, I’ll reach you before midnight.
Jay: (excited) That’d be amazing. We could grab late-night food together.
Amy: Exactly what I was thinking! Ramen?
Jay: Definitely ramen. And then dessert.
Amy: (laughs) You’re already planning our menu.
Jay: Of course. Food is love.
Amy: (smiling) Food and you—that’s all I need.
Jay: Aww, you’re gonna make me blush in my dark little apartment.
Amy: (teasing) Good. Blushing Jay is my favorite Jay.
Jay: (grinning) You’re lucky you can’t see me right now. I’m literally smiling like an idiot.
Amy: (laughing) I can hear it in your voice!
Jay: (pretending serious) No, no, I’m stone cold serious. Zero emotion.
Amy: (snickers) Liar.
Amy: You know what’s funny?
Jay: What?
Amy: I was looking at old pictures of us earlier. From that beach trip last summer.
Jay: Ohhh, when you made me build that lopsided sandcastle?
Amy: (laughs) It wasn’t lopsided, it had… personality.
Jay: (teasing) It collapsed within five minutes.
Amy: Okay, fine. But it was still cute! And… we looked so happy in those photos.
Jay: (softer) We were. We are.
Amy: Yeah… It just hit me, looking at them, how different it feels being apart. Sometimes I worry—like—what if the distance makes us drift without realizing it?
Jay: (gentle pause, then steady) Amy, listen to me. I know it’s not easy. Some days feel heavier than others. But I don’t ever feel like I’m drifting from you. If anything, I feel closer, because we actually try. You know?
Amy: (quietly) Yeah… I guess that’s true. We make the effort.
Jay: Exactly. All the late-night calls, the good morning texts, the dumb memes we send… That’s not drifting. That’s us holding on.
Amy: (sniffling a little) You’re gonna make me cry.
Jay: (soft laugh) Don’t cry, baby. Or if you do, just know I’d hug you if I could.
Amy: (smiles through tears) Ugh, I hate that you’re good with words sometimes.
Jay: (grinning) Only sometimes?
Amy: (laughs) Okay, most times.
Jay: (warmly) Good. Because I mean it. I love you, Amy. Distance or not.
Amy: (quiet but firm) I love you too, Jay. Always.
(there’s a pause—just silence and breathing, but it feels full, not empty)
Jay: You okay?
Amy: Yeah. Better now. I just… needed to hear that.
Jay: Anytime. That’s what I’m here for.
Amy: (yawns softly) Okay… I’m officially fading.
Jay: (gentle laugh) I can tell. Your voice goes all soft when you’re sleepy.
Amy: Does not.
Jay: (teasing) Does too. You sound like a tiny kitten about to curl up in a blanket.
Amy: (giggles) That’s oddly specific.
Jay: (smiling) Because I’ve seen it. You, wrapped in your blanket, only your nose peeking out.
Amy: (mock pout) You’re making me miss our movie nights.
Jay: Me too. Remember when you fell asleep halfway through that thriller and I had to finish it alone?
Amy: (laughs) Hey, it was boring!
Jay: Boring? It had car chases and explosions!
Amy: Exactly—too loud. I like cozy movies.
Jay: (grinning) Fine. Next time we’re together, I’ll let you pick. Even if it’s some cheesy rom-com.
Amy: (excited) Deal. And you’re not allowed to complain.
Jay: I’ll suffer silently. For love.
Amy: (laughs) Drama king.
(there’s a comfortable pause, just the faint hum of the line between them)
Jay: You should sleep, baby. You’ve had a long day.
Amy: Mmm… but I don’t wanna hang up yet.
Jay: (softly) I know. Me neither.
Amy: Can we… just stay on a little longer? Even if we don’t talk?
Jay: Of course. I’ll stay until you fall asleep.
Amy: (sleepy smile in her voice) You always do that.
Jay: Always will.
Amy: (murmurs) I love you, Jay.
Jay: (gentle) I love you too, Amy. Sweet dreams.
