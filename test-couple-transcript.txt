Amy: Oh hi! I wasn’t expecting you to answer the phone. Did I wake you?
Jay: Hey, Amy… no, no, you didn’t wake me. Honestly, I’ve been lying here staring at the ceiling for a while. Couldn’t really fall asleep myself. I kept checking my phone like a maniac, hoping maybe you’d message or call. So hearing you right now? It’s the best surprise. What’s going on—having trouble sleeping too?
Amy: I’m really sorry. I know it’s really late, but I just couldn’t get any sleep and, well, I wanted to talk to you.
Jay: Don’t apologize. You never need to apologize for calling me, especially at night. I’d rather lose sleep talking to you than lie here restless without hearing your voice. It’s kind of funny—we’re both bad at being apart. You know, usually I can fall asleep fast, but tonight it just felt off. I kept reaching to the other side of the bed, forgetting it’s empty. I miss the way you toss around and steal the blanket.
Amy: Of course I’m not homesick. I’m not a kid anymore.But this is the first time in a long time that we’ve been this far from each other. It feels weird to not have you near me.
Jay: I get it. It’s weird for me too. The apartment feels too quiet. Even the little sounds you make—like brushing your teeth, humming in the kitchen, dropping things in the sink—those noises are part of my night routine now. Without them, the place feels hollow. And the bed feels like it’s twice as big as it actually is. I thought maybe I’d enjoy stretching out… nope. It just feels empty without you there.
Amy: What I would have given to bring you here on this trip with me…
Jay: Believe me, I was thinking the same thing earlier. Imagining sneaking into your suitcase—though with my size, I don’t think TSA would’ve let that slide. But seriously, if I were there, after your meetings we could grab late-night food, maybe wander the city lights. I wouldn’t even care if it was boring; being with you makes anything fun. Next trip, I’m coming along, even if I have to tag along like your “emotional support human.”
Amy: No, don’t be silly. You don’t have to fly over here. I’m heading back tomorrow evening anyways, so we should see each other again.
Jay: Tomorrow evening… okay, that’s doable. I’m literally counting down the hours now. I might even clean the place up a little so it feels nice when you walk in. You know, set the stage with fresh sheets, maybe a hot meal waiting. Nothing fancy—probably pasta or something easy—but it’ll feel good to welcome you home.
Amy: But…I did want to hear your voice again…
Jay: And I wanted to hear yours. Honestly, you’ve got no idea how much calmer I feel just listening to you. It’s like everything slows down. Keep me on the phone for as long as you need—I don’t care if I fall asleep mid-call, as long as you’re talking to me.
Amy: I don’t know why, but just hearing you makes me feel better.
Jay: Same here. It’s like medicine. It’s weird, isn’t it? Technology can’t really replace touch or presence, but your voice… it’s close. It makes me imagine you right here next to me.
Amy: No, I’m ok. It’s just…you know how these business trips are.
Jay: Oh, I can imagine. Early mornings, long meetings, coffee that never tastes as good as it should. And people trying to sound smarter than they are in boardrooms. I don’t envy you, but I admire you for handling all that with grace.
Amy: There’s no time for sightseeing or doing anything fun. It’s just getting on a plane, then going to the hotel, then being in a bunch of boring meetings for hours, then heading back to the hotel and going to bed.Even then, I didn’t get much sleep. I spent all night getting our group presentation ready.
Jay: That sounds brutal. You must be running on fumes. I wish I could’ve been there to force you to put the laptop down and get some rest. You always push yourself so hard. But knowing you, all that effort probably paid off. You never half-do anything—you give it everything.
Amy: Yeah the meetings went great! I think? I did my best to show our project and everyone seemed impressed with the work our team put in.
Jay: I knew it! That’s my Amy. I bet you were the star of the room, even if you don’t realize it. I can just picture you standing there, explaining everything confidently, and everyone nodding along impressed. I’m honestly so proud of you, and I wish I could’ve been in the audience clapping the loudest.
Amy: I’m not the lead of my department for nothing. You always told me how smart I was and always pushed me to study and work hard. And all that work has paid off.
Jay: And you’ve proved me right again. You know, I was thinking earlier tonight about how far you’ve come since we first met. Back then, you used to stress about whether you were doing “enough,” and now you’re out there leading teams and presenting to big groups of people like it’s second nature. It’s wild. Sometimes I feel like I should be taking notes from you on how to manage life better.
Amy: Yeah, I am really tired. I did have a busy day. But even with all that, I couldn’t go to sleep.
Jay: I get that. Your brain’s still buzzing from the day. That happens to me too when I’ve had a lot on my plate—lying down doesn’t quiet things down, it just makes them louder somehow. If I were there, I’d probably suggest we put on a silly movie, something light to distract you, and I’d rub your shoulders until you passed out. Works every time.
Amy: No, it has nothing to do with the room I’m in. They actually put us in this really nice hotel. Everything is so clean and fancy. They served us free meals and we each got our own individual room.It also has a very beautiful view. You can see the entire city from here. And the bed is so soft and fluffy.
Jay: Wow, sounds like you’re staying in a five-star palace. Meanwhile, I just heated up leftover pizza and the couch cushions are probably the fanciest thing I sat on all day. But honestly, even the nicest hotel feels empty without the right company. I bet you’d trade that fluffy bed for our squeaky old mattress if it meant I was there next to you. And yes, tomorrow you need to send me a photo of that city view—it’ll make me feel like I’m sharing a tiny piece of your trip.
Amy: But there’s something missing. Something that even this fancy pants hotel doesn’t have.
Jay: Let me guess—it doesn’t come with a built-in boyfriend who tells bad jokes and hogs half the blanket?
Amy: Well that thing…is you.You have no idea how much I miss you. No amount of pillows, plushies, or blankets could ever replace the feeling of you beside me.
Jay: I miss you too, Amy. I tried hugging the extra pillow tonight—it’s not the same. It doesn’t fight back when I tug on it, and it definitely doesn’t complain that I’m too warm. Even the cat looked at me like I’d lost my mind. I think he misses you too—he kept curling up in your spot, like he’s guarding it until you come back.
Amy: What do you mean you don’t do anything special? Don’t be silly. You do a lot for me. Even if you don’t realize it.
Jay: I really don’t feel like I do much. To me it’s just… normal stuff. Like making sure you’re comfortable, checking if you’ve eaten, remembering how you like your coffee. But if that makes you feel cared for, then I’ll happily keep doing it forever.
Amy: Do I need to remind you what you do to make me feel better?When we’re in bed, you make sure I’m covered from head to toe under the blanket.And if I’m feeling sad or lonely, you put your arms around me and hold me tight. My body pressed against yours.
Jay: Yeah, I remember. And I love doing that. Honestly, it makes me feel better too—like I’m protecting my favorite person in the world. You know, last night I tried to fall asleep without you and I realized how much I depend on those little routines. Even the way you sometimes shove your cold feet against me just to warm them up—at the time I grumble, but now I kind of miss it.
Amy: (Giggle) Do you remember how I reacted when you first did that? I was so surprised I let out a small yelp. You got so scared, you almost fell off the bed.But it wasn’t because I didn’t want you close. It was just because I wasn’t used to someone else touching me that way before.
Jay: Oh, I remember. I thought I’d ruined everything in that split second. My heart nearly stopped when you yelped. But then you started laughing and pulled me back, and I realized maybe I hadn’t messed it up after all. That’s one of those memories that’s burned into my brain forever.
Amy: I’ll admit, it was a little awkward the first few times. But after a while, it became really natural.You’re always looking out for me. When I’m cold, you make sure to wrap the blanket around us to keep each other warm.If I’m having a bad dream, you always find a way to gently wrap your arms around me without waking me up. But once I feel the warmth from you, all my troubles just fade away.
Jay: That means more to me than you know. Half the time when you’re asleep and I notice you’re shivering or twitching, I just instinctively pull you closer. I don’t even think about it—it’s like my body knows what you need before I do. And hearing you say that it actually helps… well, it makes me feel like I’m doing something right.
Amy: You have no idea how special you are to me. That feeling I get when I’m in your arms, buried in your chest. Your hands holding mine, making sure I’m not cold.And when I look up, I can see my reflection in your beautiful eyes. And that warm gaze makes me feel warm and fuzzy. That I don’t have to go through anything alone. That you are always there to support me.
Jay: Amy… you don’t know how much it means to hear that. Sometimes I wonder if I’m doing enough, or if I say the right things, but then you remind me that just being there counts. And honestly, it goes both ways. When you curl up against me, it’s not just you who feels safe. I feel grounded. Like no matter what kind of day I had, it ends with peace because you’re beside me. It’s the best therapy there is.
Amy: I know that I can just close my eyes and you’ll surprise me with your lips against mine. Always so gentle, but pressed just enough to remind me just how much youAll that makes me want to hold onto you even tighter. Because I’m afraid that I’ll lose you if I let go, even if deep in my heart I know you’ll always be there for me.And now that I don’t have that right now…it makes me a little sad. And alone…
Jay: You’ll never lose me, Amy. Not in a million years. Even when you’re far away, you’re still right here with me. I swear, I walked into the kitchen tonight and half-expected to see you sitting on the counter swinging your legs like you always do. It’s like my brain refuses to accept you’re not around. So believe me, I feel the distance too. But it’s just for tonight. Tomorrow you’ll be back, and I’ll make sure you don’t feel alone for a second.
Amy: But hearing your voice is helping me at least for tonight. But when I get back home, I expect an extra hug and kiss to make up for it.
Jay: Extra? You’re getting a whole stockpile. I’m talking long bear hugs, kisses until you push me away laughing, and maybe even breakfast in bed if you’re lucky. I’ve been saving up all the affection I didn’t get to give you today, and I’ll unload it the moment you walk through the door.
Amy: Hello? Are you still there?
Jay: Yeah, I’m here. Just smiling like an idiot at how sweet you are. Honestly, I could listen to you talk forever.
Amy: Oh. You feel asleep.
Jay: Almost… but not yet. Your voice is like a lullaby, though. If you keep talking, I might just drift off with a grin on my face.
Amy: (Soft giggle) It’s ok. I don’t blame you. I’m sure you had a busy day too. Besides, it’s already pretty late. ll be morning in a few hours.I know you’ll never admit it, but I can tell you miss me too.You answered the phone so quickly, I can tell you couldn’t sleep either.It might sound a bit selfish and mean, but that makes me happy. To know that I matter that much to you. Just as much as you matter to me.
Jay: You do. More than you’ll ever realize. And you’re right—I couldn’t sleep either. I was lying here, scrolling aimlessly, replaying our last day together before you left, thinking about your laugh, the way you leaned on me when we were watching TV. I kept reaching for my phone, hoping for a text, so when you actually called, it felt like you read my mind. If missing you makes you happy… well, then, you can be really happy tonight because I’ve been missing you like crazy.
Amy: Don’t worry. We’ll see each other again soon.Whatever I need to do, I’ll make sure you always come with me on all my trips.Maybe we could even take an extra day to sightsee or do something fun. Make it a kind of weekend vacation. That would definitively change my attitude towards these business trips.But I’m getting ahead of myself. We can talk about it and plan it out another day. Preferably when you’re awake and able to hear me. (Soft giggle)
Jay: No, I love that idea. Imagine it—we could turn your boring work trips into little adventures. You do your meetings during the day, and afterward, we explore together. Grab local food, see the sights, maybe even get lost in a city neither of us knows. It’d be like sneaking mini vacations into your career. And I’d love that. Let’s seriously plan it.
Amy: Alright, I’m going to get some sleep. See you tomorrow.Good night…I love you… (Soft, Quick Kiss)
Jay: Good night, Amy. I love you too, more than words can say. Sleep well. Dream of me, and tomorrow I’ll be right there in person.
